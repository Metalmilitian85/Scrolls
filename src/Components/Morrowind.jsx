              <div className="text-white m-8">
                <p>Morrowind takes place on Vvardenfell, an island in the Dunmer-dominated province of Morrowind, far from the typically European-inspired 
                    lands to the west and south depicted in Daggerfall and Arena. Along with graphical improvements, one of the most apparent differences 
                    between Morrowind and the earlier games in the series is that Morrowind takes place in a much smaller area than the previous games. 
                    While Arena featured the entirety of Tamriel as an explorable area, and Daggerfall featured sizeable portions of two provinces of Tamriel, 
                    Hammerfell and High Rock, Morrowind includes only the "relatively small" island of Vvardenfell within the province of Morrowind. 
                    The change was a result of a conscious choice on the part of the developers to feature more detail and variety in the game. Whereas Daggerfall 
                    and Arena's dungeons were randomly generated, each area in Morrowind was specifically detailed, and each item was individually placed. 
                    As a result, reviewers were generally impressed with the game world's variety, as this maintained the perception of an "enormous" game-world. 
                    The game area expands to the walled city of Mournhold on Morrowind's mainland in the Tribunal expansion, and the island of Solstheim to the 
                    northwest of Vvardenfell in the Bloodmoon expansion.</p>
                <p>Morrowind's developers, rather than basing the culture of Morrowind onto the typical Medieval European setting of fantasy games, chose a 
                    more eclectic route, taking elements from African cultures, specifically Ancient Egyptian, but also early Japanese, and Middle Eastern cultures, 
                    with Egyptian architecture cited in particular for its significant influence on Balmora's Hlaalu architecture.[32] Executive Producer Todd Howard 
                    felt that the use of Morrowind as a backdrop was integral in the development of the game's style. While admitting some elements of the partially 
                    medieval Imperial culture more typical of fantasy to retain familiarity with the earlier installments of the series, Morrowind's Dark Elven 
                    setting "opened huge new avenues for creating cultures and sites that are not traditionally seen in a fantasy setting".[33] The development 
                    team also gave particular credit to the Ridley Scott film Gladiator, high fantasy, The Dark Crystal, and Conan the Barbarian as influences.</p>
                <p>The game has over 300 books (not counting spell scrolls). One particular compilation of the text was 1,241 sheets of 8.25 Ã— 11 inch paper. 
                    PC Gamer weighted the in-game text as equal to six typical-size novels.[20] Many of these books provide long, serial stories, and provide 
                    hints as to the background and history of the game.[7] One critic, Phillip Scuderi, remembered Morrowind for its great literary richness. 
                    To him, the in-game literature and its integration within the game were Morrowind's "most original and lasting contribution to the history 
                    of games", one that would place it beside Planescape: Torment as one of the most important games of all time.[36] Such themes are echoed in 
                    other responses to the game, such as that of RPGamer's Joseph Witham, who found the story "discreet" in its progression, with a dungeon-crawling 
                    feel, standing alongside a "whole world of unique history" with books forming the greater part of the player's interaction with that world. 
                    Most of the books were reused in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.</p>
                <p>The game has a great deal of geographic variation in climate, flora, and, to some extent, fauna as well. Besides that, there is also some variety 
                    in politics and culture among the in-game populations, the combination of which adds to the uniqueness of different parts of the island. On top of 
                    that, there is an archaeological aspect to the game, which gives a certain degree of depth to the story as well as the option for further exploration. 
                    Additionally, there are various kinds of limits in visibility such as fog and dust, which are countered with "clear day/night" effects that also 
                    enhance visibility to some extent.</p>
                <p>The in-game exploration is chiefly based on walking and running; however, there are instances when swimming and sometimes levitation is involved. 
                    Transportation of other kinds, such as teleportation, and traveling by boat or on the back of giant flea-like creatures called silt striders, is 
                    available for a fee when moving between the various settlements on Vvardenfell as a method of fast travel.</p>
