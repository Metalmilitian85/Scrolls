                <p>Like its predecessor The Infernal City, the novel Lord of Souls takes places about 40 years after the events of 
                    The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and The Elder Scrolls IV: Shivering Isles, and some 160 years prior to the events 
                    of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.</p>
                <p>Prince Attrebus carries on with his quest to obtain a magical sword Umbra, which will be able to destroy the invaders 
                    from Umbriel. In the Imperial City however, the Penitus Oculatus Agent Colin finds evidence of betrayal in the heart 
                    of the Mede Empire. Sul and Attrebus, captured by Malacath, escape and resume the search for Umbra, and are led to a 
                    fort where the current wielder of Umbra has been buried alive after the sword drove him immediately insane.</p>
                <p>Annaig is again promoted after introducing new ideas and dishes into Umbriel's court, and eventually tricks a rival 
                    kitchen into confirmation that she had recreated their secret ingredient, also condemning Slyr, her assistant, to death 
                    after Slyr repeatedly tries to poison and murder her. Her mood further darkens after Mere-Glim is caught and killed 
                    while attempting to lead the skraws in another raid. Annaig is then forced to become a slave of dark lord of Umbriel, 
                    who has an insatiable hunger for souls.</p>
